# Music Recommendation System using YouTube Music API

## 🎶 Overview
This project is a **Music Recommendation System** that leverages the **YouTube Music API** to fetch music data and provide personalized song recommendations. Using **machine learning algorithms**, the system analyzes user preferences and suggests songs accordingly.

## 🚀 Features
- ✅ **YouTube Music API Integration** – Fetches real-time music data
- ✅ **Personalized Recommendations** – Suggests songs based on user history
- ✅ **Machine Learning Model** – Enhances recommendation accuracy
- ✅ **User-Friendly Interface** – Simplifies interaction with the system

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries & Tools:**
  - `youtubemusicapi` – Fetching music data
  - `pandas` – Data processing
  - `scikit-learn` – Machine learning model
  - `numpy` – Data handling
  - `Flask` (optional) – Web interface

## 📌 Installation & Setup
1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/music-recommendation-system.git
   cd music-recommendation-system
   ```
2. **Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended)**
   ```bash
   python -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate   # On Windows: env\Scripts\activate
   ```
3. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. **Set up API credentials**
   - Obtain the YouTube Music API key.
   - Configure the API key in the script.

5. **Run the application**
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## 🎯 How It Works
1. The user inputs their music preferences or history.
2. The system fetches relevant data from **YouTube Music API**.
3. A **machine learning model** processes the data and suggests personalized recommendations.
4. The recommended songs are displayed to the user.
